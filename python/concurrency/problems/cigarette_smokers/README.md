## Cigarette Smokers

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_smokers_problem

Assume a cigarette requires three ingredients to smoke: Tobacco, Smoking
paper, A match

Assume there are also three chain smokers around a table, each of whom has an
infinite supply of one of the three ingredients â€” one smoker has an infinite
supply of tobacco, another has an infinite supply of paper, and the third has
an infinite supply of matches.

Assume there is also a non-smoking arbiter. The arbiter enables the smokers to
make their cigarettes by arbitrarily (non deterministically) selecting two of
the smokers, taking one item out of each of their supplies, and placing the
items on the table. The arbiter then notifies the third smoker that they have
done this. The third smoker removes the two items from the table and uses them
(along with their own supply) to make a cigarette, which they smoke for a
while. Meanwhile, the arbiter, seeing the table empty, again chooses two
smokers at random and places their items on the table. This process continues
forever.

The smokers do not hoard items from the table; a smoker only begins to roll a
new cigarette once they have finished smoking the last one. For instance if
the arbiter places tobacco and paper on the table while the match-supply
smoker is smoking, the tobacco and paper will remain untouched on the table
until the match-supply smoker is finished with their cigarette and then
collects the items.
