## Sleeping Barber

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem

The analogy is based upon a hypothetical barber shop with one barber. The
barber has one barber chair and a waiting room with a number of chairs in it.
When the barber finishes cutting a customer's hair, he dismisses the customer
and then goes to the waiting room to see if there are other customers waiting.
If there are, he brings one of them back to the chair and cuts his hair. If
there are no other customers waiting, he returns to his chair and sleeps in
it.

Each customer, when he arrives, looks to see what the barber is doing. If the
barber is sleeping, then the customer wakes him up and sits in the chair. If
the barber is cutting hair, then the customer goes to the waiting room. If
there is a free chair in the waiting room, the customer sits in it and waits
his turn. If there is no free chair, then the customer leaves.
