## My Learning Playground

This repository is my home base for all things I'm working on and learning. It has notes and code from books I'm reading, problem sets from things like [Project Euler](https://github.com/dansackett/learning-playground/tree/master/project-euler), and general references for me to look at when I need them.

Not all of the code is mine as some is from book examples, but writing helps me learn. I'd love to have help in learning things so if you have any suggestions for learning the things in the following list, please open an issue to help me out.
